## Mason Meirs
I'm a linux enthusiast, low-level stuff and kernel things are my best areas. I also do gamedev.

## About Me

Casually building software and learning about thing I'm passionate about.

## Projects

SpiderWebServer - failed web server I made

os - Currently unnamed Linux-based distribution with SkyWolf369

SkyRunner - an old game I made in Unity. Nothing special.

pft - a simple and stylish fetch

vmman - a simple Virtual Machine manager and container system  using QEMU

More to come!

##  Things I use

Even though I say I'm a linux enthusiast, I use Windows 10 + WSL since I don't really need more than that.
Also love MacOS. 
I program mostly in C, C#, Python and JS/TS.
