## Mason M
I'm just an enthusiast. I just fuck around when I'm bored.

## About Me

Casually building software and learning about things I'm passionate about.

## Projects

SpiderWebServer - failed web server I made

SkyRunner - an old game I made in Unity. Nothing special.

pft - a simple and stylish fetch

vmman - a simple Virtual Machine manager and container system  using QEMU

More to come!

##  Things I use

I use Windows 10 + WSL since I don't really need more than that.
Also love MacOS. 
I program mostly in C, C#, Python and JS/TS.
